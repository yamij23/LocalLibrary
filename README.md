# ## Local Library Project

## General Information

This web page was built for a neighborhood that has decided to create a digital local library where patrons can lend and borrow books. I assisted with this project by building the javascript algorithms that render various statistics on the pages' dashboard. The project goals were:

- Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor
- Practicing writing javascript in a project based enviornment by working with large datasets.
- Building algorithms based on those datasets.
- Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types
- Solving bugs by using error messages
  Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately
- Accessing all the values and keys of an object
- Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems
- Using reduce() to solve different problems
- Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
- Using well-named variables, in particular avoiding any single letter variables that lack meaning.
- Making use of both function declarations and arrow functions.
- Building helper functions when appropriate.
- Making use of advanced JavaScript features like ternary operators, the spread operator, object shorthand, array and object destructuring, and for/in loops.
